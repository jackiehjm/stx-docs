Customize OpenStack Horizon and Login Banner Branding
=====================================================

Learn from instructions and examples for creating and applying a tarball
containing a custom |os-prod-hor-long| theme, and associated branding files,
and customizing pre-login messages \(issue\) and post-login messages.

You can modify the existing style sheet, font, and image files to develop your
own branding, package it, and then apply the branding by installing the tarball
that includes the modified files along with a manifest. For more information,
see |sysconf-doc|: :ref:`Creating a Custom Branding
Tarball <creating-a-custom-branding-tarball>`.

You can also customize pre-login messages \(issue\) and post-login messages of
the day \(motd\) across |prod-os| during system commissioning and installation.
For more information, see |sysconf-doc|: :ref:`Branding
the Login Banner During Commissioning
<branding-the-login-banner-during-commissioning>` and :ref:`Branding the Login
Banner on a Commissioned System
