====================

Welcome to the StarlingX project!

StarlingX is a fully integrated Edge Cloud software stack that includes
everything that you need to deploy an Edge Cloud on one server,
two servers, or up to 100 servers.

StarlingX includes an operating
system, storage and networking components, and all of the Cloud
Infrastructure needed to run Edge workloads in one
easy to install package.

All of the software has
been tuned and optimized to meet Edge application requirements.

The stack pre-defines
several different configurations that are designed to meet a variety of
Edge Cloud deployment needs.

The StarlingX project's goal is to make the task of deploying and managing
a high performance Edge Cloud as simple as possible.

The StarlingX Documentation consists of number of sections. The
other documents in this Introduction section will help you learn some
of the basic concepts of StarlingX and how to find more detailed
information on the software.
