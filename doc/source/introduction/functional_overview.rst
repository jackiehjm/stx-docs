**Hardened Linux**
    Linux 5.10 Yocto-based kernel ( https://www.yoctoproject.org/ ) 

    The Yocto Project Kernel:

    * tracks stable kernel updates very closely; staying very current with the
      stable kernel,

    * provides a reliable implementation of the pre-empt-rt patchset (see:
      https://rt.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page), and

    * provides predictable and searchable |CVE| handling.

    |org| leverages its existing relationships with the Yocto Project to
    enhance development, bug fixes and other activities in the Yocto Project kernel
    to drive |prod| quality and feature content.

    *   Debian Bullseye (11.3)

        Debian is a well-established Linux Distribution supported by a large and
        mature open-source community.

    *   OSTree ( https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual/introduction/ )

        OSTree provides for robust and efficient versioning, packaging and
        upgrading of Linux-based systems.

    *   An updated Installer to seamlessly adapt to Debian and OSTree

    *   Updated software patching and upgrades for Debian and OSTree.


**Variety of open-source software supporting StarlingX and/or Kubernetes**
    This includes packages such as Apache, Ceph, PostgreSql, Etcd, |IPMI|,
    etc., as well as some services from OpenStack such as the OpenStack
    Horizon Web interface, Keystone and Barbican.

**StarlingX**
    Hardware and software infrastructure management.

    -   Manages installation, maintenance and fault monitoring of dedicated
        bare metal servers running the |org| solution.

    -   Manages the configuration of hardware and software services running
        on the host servers.

    -   Provides the cluster management for services running on the HA
        master/control nodes cluster, as well critical software monitoring and
        recovery of services running on all nodes within the cluster.

    -   Monitoring and reporting of faults and logs of both hardware and
        software services.

    -   Support for managing software updates to all layers of software in
        the solution; this includes kernel, operating system, open-source
        packages, StarlingX and Kubernetes.

**Kubernetes**
    -   Kubernetes Container Orchestration Engine

    -   Native Docker Runtime

    -   Calico Container Networking

    -   Accelerated Container Networking with multus and |SRIOV| |CNIs|

    -   Persistent Volume Claims backed by Ceph

    -   Local Docker Registry

    -   Helm / Tiller â€“ Kubernetes Package Manager, and

    -   FluxCD

**OpenStack**

    -   Nova - compute management

    -   Neutron - network management

    -   Glance - image management

    -   Cinder - block storage

    -   OpenStack Horizon - dashboard

    ..  -   Telemetry (OPTIONAL)

            -   Panko - Event storage
