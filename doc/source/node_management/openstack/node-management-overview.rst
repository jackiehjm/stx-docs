Overview

You can add OpenStack compute nodes to an existing |AIO| Duplex system, and use
labels to identify OpenStack Nodes.

Guidelines for |VMs| in a Duplex system remain unchanged.

For more information on using labels to identify OpenStack Nodes, see
:ref:`Using Labels to Identify OpenStack Nodes
<using-labels-to-identify-openstack-nodes>`.

For more information on adding compute nodes to an existing Duplex system, see
:ref:`Adding Compute Nodes to an Existing Duplex System
