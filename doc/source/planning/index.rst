Kubernetes

|prod| platform planning helps ensure that the requirements of your containers,
and the requirements of your cloud administration and operations teams can be
met. It ensures proper integration of a |prod| into the target data center or
telecom office, and helps you plan up front for future cloud growth.

Planning your |prod| installation is a prerequisite for further |prod-os|
installation planning.
