Security Hardening Introduction
===============================

Platform infrastructure hardening is an obligatory task for achieving
resilience to infrastructure attacks and complying with regulatory
requirements.

Hackers attack on an ongoing basis using various cyber-attack techniques
that are called attack vectors.

|prod| nodes must be hardened to reduce the increasing amounts of
dynamically emerging cyber-attacks.


|prod| provides a broad number of features related to system security. The
scope of this document is to provide information about these security
features to support best practice security hardening along with knowledge
about the features' various impacts on operation and performance.

The security hardening features can be classified into the following layers:

-   Operating System hardening

-   Platform hardening

-   Application hardening

This appendix covers the security features hardening the operating system
and platform. Application hardening is not in the scope of this document.
