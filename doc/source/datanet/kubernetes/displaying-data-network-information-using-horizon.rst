Display Data Network Information Using Horizon
==============================================

You can view data network details from the Horizon Web interface or the CLI.
You can also view data network topologies from Horizon.

.. rubric:: |context|

Using Horizon, you can obtain information about data networks using the
following:

The **Data Network Topology** view. This is a graphical representation of all
data networks on the system and their connections to worker hosts. You can
select individual data networks to view details. You can also review active
alarms for data network connections.

.. For more information, see :ref:`The Data Network Topology View <the-data-network-topology-view>`.

.. note::
    You cannot make changes from this view.

Both places use the **Data Network Details** tab to present details. If you
prefer, you can view the details using the CLI; for more information, see
:ref:`Displaying Data Network Information Using the CLI
<displaying-data-network-information-using-the-cli>`.
