====================================
Configure Data Interfaces for VXLANs
====================================

For data interfaces attached to VXLAN-based data networks, endpoint IP
addresses, \(static or dynamic from a IP Address pool\) and possibly IP
Routes are additionally required on the host data interfaces.

You can complete the VXLAN data network setup by using the web
administration interface or the CLI. For more information on setting up
VXLAN Data Networks, see tasks related to :ref:`VXLAN data network setup
completion <adding-a-static-ip-address-to-a-data-interface>`.
