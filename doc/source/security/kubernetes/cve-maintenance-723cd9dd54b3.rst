-  |CVSS| v3 base scores and base metrics are used in the |CVE| fix criteria

-  The |CVE| ``Fix Criteria Policy`` is:

   -  Main Fix Criteria

      -  |CVSS| v3 Base score >= 7.0
      -  Base Metrics has the following:

         -  Attack Vector: Network
         -  Attack Complexity: Low
         -  Privileges Required: None or Low
         -  Availability Impact: High or Low
         -  User Interaction: None
      -  A correction is available upstream

   -  OR, visibility is HIGH and a correction is available upstream
