   On a monthly basis, the master development branch of StarlingX is scanned
   for CVEs using the third party tool ``Vulscan`` to provide an unbiased view
   of vulnerabilities. The generated reports are reviewed by the Security team.
   For |CVE|'s which meet StarlingX's CVE Fix Criteria Policy as documented
   below, fixes are provided in the StarlingX master branch.

   .. note::
      
      There are no scans executed or |CVE| fixes implemeneted on the released
      versions / branches on StarlingX.

   For the current Debian-based versions of StarlingX:
   
   -  |CVSS| v3.x base scores and base metrics are used in the |CVE| fix criteria

   -  The |CVE| ``Fix Criteria Policy`` is:

      -  Main Fix Criteria

         -  |CVSS| v3.x Base score >= 7.0
         -  Base Metrics has the following:

            -  Attack Vector: Network
            -  Attack Complexity: Low
            -  Privileges Required: None or Low
            -  Availability Impact: High or Low
            -  User Interaction: None

   -  |CVSS| v2 base scores and base vectors were used in the |CVE| fix criteria
   
   -  The |CVE| ``Fix Criteria Policy`` was:

      -  Main Fix Criteria

         -  |CVSS| v2 Base score >= 7.0

            -  Access Vector: Network
            -  Access Complexity: Low
            -  Authentication: None or Single
            -  Availability Impact: Partial/Complete
