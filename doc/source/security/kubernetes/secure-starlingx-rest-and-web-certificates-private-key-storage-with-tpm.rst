========================================================================
Secure StarlingX REST and Web Certificate's Private Key Storage with TPM
========================================================================

For increased security, the |prod| REST and Web Server's certificate can
be installed such that the private key is stored in a |TPM| 2.0 device on
the controller.

.. rubric:: |context|

|TPM| is an industry standard cryptographic processor that enables secure
storage of secrets. |prod| can use a |TPM| device, if present, to securely
store the private key of the |prod| REST and Web Server's certificate.

The |TPM| is used to wrap the private key within the |TPM| device. Each
wrapping is unique to that |TPM| device and cannot be synchronized between
controllers using different |TPM| devices. Therefore, the same private key
is always secured to both the active and standby controllers' |TPM| devices
at the same time. Given this operational constraint, |prod| has measures in
place to detect when the standby controller is reinstalled or replaced, and
raise appropriate alarms to prevent an Unlock or Swact of a new standby
controller until the |prod| REST and Web Server's certificate is
re-installed, in order to update the new standby controller's |TPM| device.

.. rubric:: |prereq|


.. _secure-starlingx-rest-and-web-certificates-private-key-storage-with-tpm-ul-xj3-mqc-d1b:

-   Obtain an Intermediate or Root |CA|-signed certificate and key from a
    trusted Intermediate or Root |CA|. Refer to the documentation for the
    external Intermediate or Root |CA| that you are using, on how to create
    public certificate and private key pairs, signed by an Intermediate or
    Root-signed |CA|, for HTTPS.

    For lab purposes, see :ref:`Create Certificates Locally using openssl
    <create-certificates-locally-using-openssl>` for details on how to create
    a test Intermediate or Root |CA| certificate and key, and use it to sign
    test certificates.

    Put the |PEM| encoded versions of the certificate and key in a
    single file, and copy the file to the controller host.

-   Both controllers must be provisioned and unlocked before you can install
    the certificate using |TPM| to store the private key.

-   A |TPM| 2.0 device must be available on both controller nodes.

-   |TPM| must be enabled in the |UEFI| on both controllers.

-   HTTPS must be enabled on the system.

.. note::

    If you plan to use the container-based remote CLIs, due to a limitation in
    the Python2 SSL certificate validation, the certificate used for the |prod|
    REST API application endpoints and |prod| Web Administration Server ('ssl')
    certificate must either have:

    #.  CN=IPADDRESS and SANs=IPADDRESS

        or

    #.  CN=FQDN and SANs=FQDN

        where IPADDRESS and |FQDN| are for the |OAM| Floating IP Address.

.. caution::

    Do not install the certificate using |TPM| on controller-0 before the
    standby controller-1 has been provisioned and unlocked. If this happens,
    you cannot unlock controller-1. To recover, do the following:

.. _secure-starlingx-rest-and-web-certificates-private-key-storage-with-tpm-ol-jpm-2kq-qcb:

#.  Install the certificate without |TPM| on controller-0. For more
    information, see :ref:`Install/Update the StarlingX Rest and Web
    Server Certificate
    <install-update-the-starlingx-rest-and-web-server-certificate>`.

#.  Unlock controller-1.

#.  Reinstall the certificate using |TPM| on controller-0.


.. rubric:: |proc|

.. _secure-starlingx-rest-and-web-certificates-private-key-storage-with-tpm-steps-hnx-qf5-x1b:

#.  Install the |prod| REST and Web Server's certificate using |TPM| to
    securely store the private key:

    .. code-block:: none

        ~(keystone_admin)]$ system certificate-install â€“m tpm_mode <pathTocertificateAndKey>

    where:

    **<pathTocertificateAndKey>**

    is the path to the file containing both the intermediate or Root
    |CA|-signed certificate and private key to install.

    .. warning::

        For security purposes, the utility deletes the provided SSL private
        key from the file system and asks for confirmation during the
        installation. You should store a copy of the SSL private key off-site.

    .. note::

        Only X.509 based RSA key certificates are supported \(PKCS12 format
        and ECDSA keys are not supported\). Additionally, 4096 bit RSA key
        lengths are not supported.

#.  Check the certificate's |TPM| configuration state for each provisioned
    controller node.

If either controller has state **tpm-config-failed**, then a 500.100
alarm is raised for the host.

-   A LOCKED controller node that is not in the |TPM| applied configuration
    state \(**tpm-config-applied**\), is prevented from being UNLOCKED

-   An UNLOCKED controller node that is not in the |TPM| applied
    configuration state \(**tpm-config-applied**\), is prevented from being
    Swacted To or upgraded.



.. rubric:: |postreq|

When reinstalling either of the controllers or during a hardware replacement
scenario, you must reinstall the certificate:

.. code-block:: none

    ~(keystone_admin)]$ system certificate-install -m tpm_mode
    <pathTocertificateAndKey>

To disable the use of |TPM| to store the private key of the |prod| REST
and Web Server's certificate, install the certificate without the |TPM|
option:

.. code-block:: none

    ~(keystone_admin)]$ system certificate-install <pathTocertificateAndKey>

.. warning::

    The REST and Web Server certificate are not automatically renewed, user
    MUST renew the certificate prior to expiry, otherwise a variety of system
    operations will fail.

-   An UNLOCKED controller node that is not in TPM applied configuration
    state \(**tpm-config-applied**\) will be prevented from being Swacted To or
    upgraded.
