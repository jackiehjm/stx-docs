Set up OIDC Auth Applications
=============================

The **oidc-auth-apps** application is a system application that needs to be
configured to use a remote Windows Active Directory server to authenticate
users of the Kubernetes API. The ``oidc-auth-apps`` is packaged in the ISO
and uploaded by default.


Configure OIDC Auth Applications
================================

.. rubric:: |prereq|

.. _configure-oidc-auth-applications-ul-gpz-x51-llb:

-   You must have configured the Kubernetes ``kube-apiserver`` to use
    the **oidc-auth-apps** |OIDC| identity provider for validation of
    tokens in Kubernetes API requests, which use |OIDC| authentication. For
    more information on configuring the Kubernetes ``kube-apiserver``, see
    :ref:`Configure Kubernetes for OIDC Token Validation while
    Bootstrapping the System
    <configure-kubernetes-for-oidc-token-validation-while-bootstrapping-the-system>`
    or :ref:`Configure Kubernetes for OIDC Token Validation after
    Bootstrapping the System
    <configure-kubernetes-for-oidc-token-validation-after-bootstrapping-the-system>`.

#. Create certificates using one of the following options.

   #. Create certificates using cert-manager (recommended):

      Certificates used by ``oidc-auth-apps`` can be managed by Cert-Manager.
      Doing so will automatically renew the certificates before they expire.
      The ``system-local-ca`` ClusterIssuer (see
      :ref:`starlingx-rest-api-applications-and-the-web-admin-server-cert-9196c5794834`)
      will be used to issue this certificate.

      .. note::
          If a signing |CA| is not a well-known trusted |CA|, you must ensure the
          system trusts the |CA| by specifying it either during the bootstrap
          phase of system installation, by specifying ``ssl_ca_cert: <certificate_file>``
          in the ansible bootstrap overrides localhost.yml file, or by using the
          :command:`system certificate-install -m ssl_ca <certificate_file>`
          command.

      Also refer to :ref:`Add a Trusted CA <add-a-trusted-ca>`
      for installing a root |CA|, which includes instruction to `lock/unlock`
      controller nodes when using :command:`system certificate-install`
      command.

      .. important::
          The namespace for ``oidc-auth-apps`` must be ``kube-system``.

      #. Create the |OIDC| client and identity provider server certificate and
         private key pair.

   #. Use certificates generated and signed by an external |CA|.

      Although it is recommended to use cert-manager to manage certificates, as
      described above in item "Create certificates using cert-manager
      (recommended)", one can instead use certificates generated by an external
      |CA|.

      For backwards compatibility reasons, the default helm chart overrides of
      dex, oidc-client and secret-observer in ``oidc-auth-apps`` application
      are set for this example of using externally generated certificates. The
      default override values of helm charts in ``oidc-auth-apps`` application
      include the use of kubernetes secrets named ``local-dex.tls``, and
      ``dex-client-secret`` for declaring the dex server certificate and the
      |CA| which signed it, respectively. These secrets are created in this
      example.

      In addition, one can indicate the |WAD| certificate for an |LDAP| server
      that has https enabled by using the secret ``wad-ca-cert`` as in this
      example.

      .. rubric:: |prereq|

      -   You must have a |CA| signed certificate (``dex-cert.pem`` file), and
          private key (``dex-key.pem file``) for the dex |OIDC| Identity
          Provider of **oidc-auth-apps**.

          This certificate *must* have the |prod|'s floating |OAM| IP Address
          in the |SAN| list. If you are planning on defining and using a DNS
          name for the |prod|'s floating |OAM| IP Address, then this DNS name
          *must* also be in the |SAN| list. Refer to the documentation for the
          external |CA| that you are using, in order to create a signed
          certificate and key.

          If you are using an intermediate |CA| to sign the dex certificate,
          include both the dex certificate (signed by the intermediate |CA|),
          and the intermediate |CA|'s certificate (signed by the Root |CA|) in
          that order, in ``dex-cert.pem``.

      -   You must have the certificate of the |CA| (``dex-ca.pem`` file) that
          signed the above certificate for the dex |OIDC| Identity Provider of
          **oidc-auth-apps**.

          If an intermediate |CA| was used to sign the dex certificate and both
          the dex certificate and the intermediate |CA| certificate was
          included in ``dex-cert.pem``, then the ``dex-ca.pem`` file should
          contain the root |CA|'s certificate.

          If the signing |CA| (``dex-ca.pem``) is not a well-known trusted
          |CA|, you must ensure the system trusts the |CA| by specifying it
          either during the bootstrap phase of system installation, by
          specifying ``ssl_ca_cert: dex-ca.pem`` in the ansible bootstrap
          overrides ``localhost.yml`` file, or by using the :command:`system
          certificate-install -m ssl_ca dex-ca.pem` command.

          Also refer to :ref:`Add a Trusted CA <add-a-trusted-ca>`
          for installing a root |CA|, which includes instruction to `lock/unlock`
          controller nodes when using :command:`system certificate-install`
          command.

      #.  Create the secret, ``local-dex.tls``, with the certificate and key,
          to be used by the **oidc-auth-apps**, as well as the secret,
          ``dex-client-secret``, with the |CA|'s certificate that signed the
          ``local-dex.tls`` certificate.

          For example, assuming the cert and key pem files for creating these
          secrets are in ``/home/sysadmin/ssl/``, run the following commands to
          create the secrets:

          .. note::
              **oidc-auth-apps** looks specifically for secrets of these names
              in the ``kube-system`` namespace.

              For the generic secret ``dex-client-secret``, the filename must
              be ``dex-ca.pem``.

          .. code-block:: none

              ~(keystone_admin)]$ kubectl create secret tls local-dex.tls --cert=ssl/dex-cert.pem --key=ssl/dex-key.pem -n kube-system

              ~(keystone_admin)]$ kubectl create secret generic dex-client-secret --from-file=/home/sysadmin/ssl/dex-ca.pem -n kube-system

          Create the secret ``wad-ca-cert`` with the |CA|'s certificate that signed
          the Active Directory's certificate using the following command:

          .. code-block:: none

              ~(keystone_admin)]$ kubectl create secret generic wad-ca-cert --from-file=ssl/wad-ca-cert.crt -n kube-system

#.  Specify user overrides for **oidc-auth-apps** application, by using the
    following command:

    .. code-block:: none

        ~(keystone_admin)]$ system helm-override-update oidc-auth-apps dex kube-system --values /home/sysadmin/dex-overrides.yaml --reuse-values

    The dex-overrides.yaml file contains the desired dex helm chart overrides
    (that is, the |LDAP| connector configuration for the Active Directory
    service, optional token expiry, and so on), and volume mounts for
    providing access to the ``wad-ca-cert`` secret, described in this section.

    For the complete list of dex helm chart values supported, see `Dex Helm
    Chart Values
    <https://github.com/dexidp/helm-charts/blob/dex-0.14.1/charts/dex/values.yaml>`__.
    For the complete list of parameters of the dex |LDAP| connector
    configuration, see `Authentication Through LDAP
    <https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/ldap/>`__.

    The overall Dex documentation is available on `dexidp.io
    <https://dexidp.io/docs/>`__.  The configuration of dex server version
    v2.36.0 is described on github
    (https://github.com/dexidp/dex/blob/v2.36.0/config.yaml.dist) with example
    ``config.dev.yaml``
    (https://github.com/dexidp/dex/blob/v2.36.0/config.dev.yaml).

    The example below configures a token expiry of ten hours, a single |LDAP|
    connector to an Active Directory service using HTTPS (LDAPS) using the
    ``wad-ca-cert`` secret configured in this section, the required Active
    Directory service login information (that is, bindDN, and bindPW), and
    example :command:`userSearch`, and :command:`groupSearch` clauses.

    (Optional) There is a default secret in the dex configuration for
    ``staticClients``. You can change this using helm overrides. For example,
    to change the secret, first run the following command to see the default
    settings. In this example, ``10.10.10.2`` is the |prod-long| |OAM| floating
    IP address.

    .. code-block:: none

        ~(keystone_admin)]$ system helm-override-show oidc-auth-apps dex kube-system

        config:

            redirectURIs: ['https://10.10.10.2:30555/callback']
            secret: St8rlingX

    Change the secret from the output and copy the entire configuration section
    shown above in to your dex overrides file shown in the example below.

    .. warning::
        Do not forget to include the id, name, and redirectURIs parameters.

    .. note::
        There is an internal ``client_secret`` that is used between the
        oidc-client container and the dex container. It is recommended that you
        configure a unique, more secure ``client_secret`` by specifying the
        value in the dex overrides file, as shown in the example below.

    If more than one Windows Active Directory service is required for
    authenticating the different users of the |prod|, multiple ``ldap``
    type connectors can be configured; one for each Windows Active
    Directory service.

    If more than one ``userSearch`` plus ``groupSearch`` clauses are
    required for the same Windows Active Directory service, multiple
    ``ldap`` type connectors, with the same host information but
    different ``userSearch`` plus ``groupSearch`` clauses, should be used.

    Whenever you use multiple ``ldap`` type connectors, ensure you use
    unique ``name:`` and ``id:`` parameters for each connector.

#.  An override in the secrets in the dex helm chart must be accompanied by
    an override in the oidc-client helm chart.

    The following override is sufficient for changing the secret in the
    ``/home/sysadmin/oidc-client-overrides.yaml`` file.

    .. code-block:: none

        config:
          client_secret: BetterSecret

        ~(keystone_admin)]$ system helm-override-update oidc-auth-apps oidc-client kube-system --values /home/sysadmin/oidc-client-overrides.yaml --reuse-values

    .. note::

        If you need to manually override the secrets, the client_secret in the
        oidc-client overrides must match the staticClients secret and
        client_secret in the dex overrides, otherwise the oidc-auth |CLI|
        client will not function.

Default helm overrides for oidc-auth-apps application
=====================================================

For backwards compatibility reasons, the default helm overrides for dex helm
are:

.. note::

    It is NOT recommended to use these; it is recommended to create
    certificates using ``cert-manager`` and explicitly refer to the resulting
    certificate secrets in user-specified helm overrides, as described on the
    procedure above.
