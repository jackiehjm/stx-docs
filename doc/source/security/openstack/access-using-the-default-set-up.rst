Access Using the Default Set-up
===============================

Upon installation, you can access the system using either the local |CLI| via
the local console and/or ssh, and |os-prod-hor-long|, the WRO administrative
web service.

For details on the local |CLI|, see :ref:`Use Local CLIs <use-local-clis>`.

For convenience, the |prod-os| administrative web service, Horizon, is
initially made available on node port 31000, i.e. at URL
http://<oam-floating-ip-address>:31000.

After setting the domain name, see :ref:`Configure Remote CLIs
<configure-remote-clis-and-clients>`, |os-prod-hor-long| is accessed by a
different URL.
