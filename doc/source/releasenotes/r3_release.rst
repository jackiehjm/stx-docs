Known limitations in R3.0
-------------------------

The following are known limitations in the StarlingX R3.0 release. Workarounds
are suggested where applicable. Note that these limitations are considered
temporary and will likely be resolved in a future release.

********************************
Changing Keystone admin password
********************************

After the Keystone admin password is changed, kube-system namespace registry
secrets must be manually updated.
Tracking Launchpad: https://bugs.launchpad.net/starlingx/+bug/1853017

It is recommended that the Keystone admin password not be changed unless necessary.

**Workaround:** If you must update the WRCP's Keystone admin user password in R3.0,
you must also manually update the kube-system namespace's registry secrets that
hold the admin password for image pulls:

#. Update the WRCP Keystone admin user password:

   ::

     openstack user set --password newP@ssw0rd admin

#. Update the kube-system namespace's `registry-local-secret` secret:

   ::

     kubectl -n kube-system create secret docker-registry registry-local-secret --docker-server=registry.local:9001 --docker-username=admin --docker-password=newP@ssw0rd -o yaml --dry-run=true > registry-local-secret-update.yaml
     kubectl -n kube-system replace secret registry-local-secret -f registry-local-secret-update.yaml

#. Update the kube-system namespace's `default-registry-key` secret:

   ::

     kubectl -n kube-system create secret docker-registry default-registry-key --docker-server=registry.local:9001 --docker-username=admin --docker-password=newP@ssw0rd -o yaml --dry-run=true > default-registry-key-update.yaml
     kubectl -n kube-system replace secret default-registry-key -f default-registry-key-update.yaml

In a distributed cloud deployment, the registry secrets must also be updated on
all subclouds in the system.
