==============================
Replace OSDs and Journal Disks
==============================

You can replace failed storage devices on storage nodes.

.. rubric:: |context|

For best results, ensure the replacement disk is the same size as others in
the same peer group. Do not substitute a smaller disk than the original.

The replacement disk is automatically formatted and updated with data when the
storage host is unlocked. For more information, see |node-doc|: :ref:`Change
Hardware Components for a Storage Host
