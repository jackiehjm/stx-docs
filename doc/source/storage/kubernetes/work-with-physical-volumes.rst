Work with Physical Volumes
==========================

Physical volumes provide storage for local volume groups on controller or
compute hosts. You can work with them in order to configure local volume
groups.

You can add, delete, and review physical volumes using the |CLI| or OpenStack
Horizon Web interface.

To use OpenStack Horizon, select **Admin** \> **Platform** \> **Host
Inventory**, and then click the host name to open the Host Details page. On
the Host Details page, select the Storage tab.

Physical volumes are created on available disks or partitions. As each
physical volume is created, it is included in an existing local volume group.
