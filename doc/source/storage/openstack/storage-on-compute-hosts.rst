Storage on Compute Hosts
========================

Compute-labelled worker hosts can provide ephemeral storage for Virtual Machine
\(VM) disks.

.. note::

    On All-in-One Simplex or Duplex systems, compute storage is provided using
    resources on the combined host. For more information, see |os-intro-doc|:
    :ref:`Storage on Controller Hosts <storage-configuration-storage-on-controller-hosts>`.
