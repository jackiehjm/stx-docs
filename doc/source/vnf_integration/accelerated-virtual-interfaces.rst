Accelerated Virtual Interfaces
==============================

|VNFs| can be configured to use |org| |AVP| to improve throughput when
compared to emulated virtual drivers.

The |prod-os| |AVP| virtual |NIC| is a shared memory based high performance networking
device. Its potential maximum throughput is higher than other emulated virtual
|NIC| devices \(for example, e1000\). For more information, see
:ref:`wrs-avp-pmd—Accelerated DPDK Network Drivers
