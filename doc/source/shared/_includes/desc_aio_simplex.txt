The All-in-one Simplex (AIO-SX) deployment option provides all three cloud
functions (controller, worker, and storage) on a single server with the
following benefits:

* Requires only a small amount of cloud processing and storage power
* Application consolidation using multiple containers or virtual machines on a
  single pair of physical servers
* A storage backend solution using a single-node CEPH deployment

.. note::

   If you are behind a corporate firewall or proxy, you need to set proxy
   settings. Refer to :ref:`docker_proxy_config` for
   details.

An AIO-SX deployment gives no protection against overall server hardware fault.
Hardware component protection can be enabled with, for example, a hardware RAID
or 2x Port LAG in the deployment.
