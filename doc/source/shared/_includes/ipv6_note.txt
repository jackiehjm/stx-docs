.. note::

   By default, |prod| uses IPv4. To use |prod| with IPv6:

   * The entire infrastructure and cluster configuration must be IPv6, with the
     exception of the |PXE| boot network.

   * Not all external servers are reachable via IPv6 addresses (for example
     Docker registries). Depending on your infrastructure, it may be necessary
     to deploy a NAT64/DNS64 gateway to translate the IPv4 addresses to IPv6.
