The Standard with Dedicated Storage deployment option is a standard installation
with independent controller, worker, and storage nodes.

A Standard with Dedicated Storage configuration provides the following benefits:

* A pool of up to 100 worker nodes
* A 2x node high availability (HA) controller cluster with HA services running
  across the controller nodes in either active/active or active/standby mode
* A storage back end solution using a two-to-9x node HA CEPH storage cluster
  that supports a replication factor of two or three
* Up to four groups of 2x storage nodes, or up to three groups of 3x storage
  nodes

.. note::

   If you are behind a corporate firewall or proxy, you need to set proxy
   settings. Refer to :ref:`docker_proxy_config` for details.
