.. note::

   By default, StarlingX uses IPv4. To use StarlingX with IPv6:

   * The entire infrastructure and cluster configuration must be IPv6, with the
     exception of the PXE boot network.

   * Not all external servers are reachable via IPv6 addresses (for example
     Docker registries). Depending on your infrastructure, it may be necessary
     to deploy a NAT64/DNS64 gateway to translate the IPv4 addresses to IPv6.

   * Refer to the :doc:`/developer_resources/stx_ipv6_deployment` guide
     for details on how to deploy a NAT64/DNS64 gateway to use StarlingX
     with IPv6.
