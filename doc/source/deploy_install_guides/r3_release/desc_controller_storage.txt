The Standard with Controller Storage deployment option provides two high
availability (HA) controller nodes and a pool of up to 10 worker nodes.

A Standard with Controller Storage configuration provides the following benefits:

* A pool of up to 10 worker nodes
* High availability (HA) services run across the controller nodes in either
  active/active or active/standby mode
* A storage back end solution using a two-node CEPH deployment across two
  controller servers
* Protection against overall controller and worker node failure, where

  * On overall controller node failure, all controller HA services go active on
    the remaining healthy controller node
  * On overall worker node failure, virtual machines and containers are
    recovered on the remaining healthy worker nodes
