The All-in-one Duplex (AIO-DX) deployment option provides a pair of high
availability (HA) servers with each server providing all three cloud functions
(controller, compute, and storage).

An AIO-DX configuration provides the following benefits:

* Only a small amount of cloud processing and storage power is required
* Application consolidation using multiple virtual machines on a single pair of
  physical servers
* High availability (HA) services run on the controller function across two
  physical servers in either active/active or active/standby mode
* A storage back end solution using a two-node CEPH deployment across two servers
* Virtual machines scheduled on both compute functions
* Protection against overall server hardware fault, where

  * All controller HA services go active on the remaining healthy server
  * All virtual machines are recovered on the remaining healthy server
