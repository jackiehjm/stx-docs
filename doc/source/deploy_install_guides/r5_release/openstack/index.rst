StarlingX OpenStack
===================

This section describes the steps to install and access StarlingX OpenStack.
Other than the OpenStack-specific configurations required in the underlying
StarlingX Kubernetes infrastructure (described in the installation steps for
StarlingX Kubernetes), the installation of containerized OpenStack for StarlingX
is independent of deployment configuration.
