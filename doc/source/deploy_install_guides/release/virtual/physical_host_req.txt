    apt-get update

#. Clone the StarlingX tools repository:

   ::

    apt-get install -y git
    cd $HOME
    git clone https://opendev.org/starlingx/virtual-deployment.git

#. Install required packages:

   ::

    cd $HOME/virtual-deployment/libvirt
    bash install_packages.sh
    apt install -y apparmor-profiles
    apt-get install -y ufw
    ufw disable
    ufw status


   .. note::

      On Ubuntu 16.04, if apparmor-profile modules were installed as shown in
      the example above, you must reboot the server to fully install the
      apparmor-profile modules.


#. Get the latest StarlingX ISO from the
   `StarlingX mirror <https://mirror.starlingx.windriver.com/mirror/starlingx/release/latest_release/debian/monolithic/outputs/iso/>`_.
   Alternately, you can get an older release ISO from `here <https://mirror.starlingx.windriver.com/mirror/starlingx/release/>`_.
