The Standard with Rook Storage deployment option is a standard installation
with independent controller and worker nodes.

A Standard with Rook Storage configuration provides the following benefits:

* A pool of up to 100 worker nodes
* A 2x node high availability (HA) controller cluster with HA services running
  across the controller nodes in either active/active or active/standby mode
* A Rook storage back end solution using a two-to-9x node HA Rook storage
  cluster that supports a replication factor of two or three

.. note::

   If you are behind a corporate firewall or proxy, you need to set proxy
   settings. Refer to :doc:`/../../configuration/docker_proxy_config` for
   details.
